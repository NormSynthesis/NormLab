This is NormLab, a framework to support research on norm synthesis.
NormLab is composed of two main elements:

1. Two MAS simulators (project NormLabSimulators) that allow to perform
simulations of a road traffic scenario and an on-line community scenario.
 
2. A Norm Synthesis Machine that can be employed to synthesise norms at
runtime in the simulations performed by the two aforementioned simulators.

The NormLab software and documentation is licensed under the "New BSD" license.
You are free to execute, modify and distribute NormLab. 

We hope you enjoy NormLab and you find it useful!
